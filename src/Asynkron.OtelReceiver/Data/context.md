# `Data` Context

The data layer converts OTLP payloads into persisted records and exposes read/write utilities.

## Core files

- [`EfModel.cs`](EfModel.cs) – defines `OtelReceiverContext` and EF Core entity types (`SpanEntity`, `LogEntity`,
  `SpanAttributeValueEntity`, `MetricEntity`, metadata tables, etc.). Indices mirror common query patterns (trace/span
  IDs, service names).
- [`ModelRepo.cs`](ModelRepo.cs) – orchestrates persistence of spans, logs, metrics, snapshots, and metadata. It batches
  OTLP messages, uses provider-specific span inserters, records receiver metrics, and exposes snapshot/metadata APIs
  consumed by gRPC services.
- [`PrometheusModel.cs`](PrometheusModel.cs) & [`PrometheusRepo.cs`](PrometheusRepo.cs) – currently commented
  scaffolding for querying Prometheus alongside TraceLens state.

## Providers

- [`Providers/context.md`](Providers/context.md) documents database-specific strategies for inserting spans.

### Usage notes

- `ModelRepo.SaveTrace` writes spans via `ISpanBulkInserter`, updates attribute/name lookup tables with
  conflict-tolerant raw SQL, persists the normalised `SpanAttributeValues` rows alongside span records, and records
  ingestion counters.
- `ModelRepo.GetTrace` retrieves all spans and logs for a specific trace ID sequentially to avoid EF Core concurrency 
  issues, deserializing the stored protobuf data and returning them wrapped in `SpanWithService` messages for complete 
  trace visibility.
- `ModelRepo.GetRandomTrace` retrieves a truly random trace by counting distinct trace IDs, using `Random.Shared` to 
  skip to a random position, and returning the corresponding trace with its spans and logs. This is useful for testing 
  and demonstration purposes without requiring knowledge of specific trace IDs. Queries are executed sequentially to 
  prevent EF Core InvalidOperationException when multiple operations run on the same DbContext.
- `ModelRepo.SearchTraces` now annotates matching attribute clauses (span id, key, value) and can optionally hydrate the
  original OTLP span protos when callers set `include_span_protos` on the request. Span-attribute predicates are pushed
  to SQL using the normalised table before trace hydration so limit handling no longer drops matches, and evaluator
  fallbacks read from the same projection when the denormalised `AttributeMap` is empty.
- `SaveLogs` and `SaveMetrics` transform OTLP structures into relational rows while formatting log bodies and populating
  attribute indexes for downstream search.
- `LogEntity` normalises both resource and record attributes into the `LogAttributes` table so `ModelRepo.SearchTraces`
  can push log-body and log-attribute predicates to SQL instead of filtering hydrated entities in memory.
- Snapshot and metadata endpoints support TraceLens visualisation features (see [
  `../TraceLens/context.md`](../TraceLens/context.md)).
- `ModelRepo.SearchTraces` accepts the TraceLens filter expression tree (see `tracelens.proto`) and translates
  span-level attribute/service predicates into SQL so composite AND/OR searches are evaluated in the database before
  results are hydrated. Error and duration leaf filters are recognised as well; duration bounds are pushed down to SQL
  while error checks run alongside the existing in-memory evaluation. Attribute filters support multiple operators:
  `EQUALS`, `EXISTS`, `CONTAINS`, `NOT_EQUALS`, `GREATER_THAN`, `LESS_THAN`, `GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL`, and
  `LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL`, all of which are pushed to SQL for efficient querying.
- Read-focused helpers in `ModelRepo` use `AsNoTracking()` so metadata/service-map lookups and search projections avoid
  unnecessary EF Core change tracking overhead.
