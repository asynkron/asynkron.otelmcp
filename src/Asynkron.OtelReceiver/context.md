# `Asynkron.OtelReceiver` Project Context

This ASP.NET Core gRPC service ingests OTLP telemetry and persists it using Entity Framework Core. The project packs as
the global tool `dotnet-otelmcp`, enabling the server to run via `dotnet otelmcp`. Key entry points:

- [`Program.cs`](Program.cs) bootstraps the web host as a standard ASP.NET Core application, wires up the SQLite-backed EF Core factory, registers ingestion
  services, enables JSON transcoding so TraceLens gRPC endpoints are also reachable over HTTP, and ensures migrations are applied at startup. Configuration follows standard ASP.NET Core patterns (environment variables, command-line args, appsettings.json).
- [`ReceiverMetricsConsole.cs`](ReceiverMetricsConsole.cs) provides a Spectre.Console CLI for monitoring receiver metrics via gRPC. This is available as a library component for building custom monitoring tools that connect to the ReceiverMetricsService endpoint.
- [`appsettings.json`](appsettings.json) holds default connection strings and provider selection.
- Proto definitions (`tracelens.proto`, `receiver_metrics.proto`) generate gRPC contracts for TraceLens models and
  receiver metrics streaming. `tracelens.proto` now exposes a composable TraceLens search filter tree so clients can
  combine service, span, attribute, error, and duration predicates.

Subsystems are organised into dedicated folders:

- [`Data/context.md`](Data/context.md) – EF Core entities, repositories, and database-specific span bulk inserters.
- [`Monitoring/context.md`](Monitoring/context.md) – instrumentation that tracks receiver throughput and exposes async
  snapshots.
- [`Services/context.md`](Services/context.md) – gRPC service implementations for OTLP traces/logs/metrics, TraceLens
  data queries, custom metrics streaming, and the streaming HTTP MCP bridge.
- [`TraceLens/context.md`](TraceLens/context.md) – TraceLens domain logic, extractors, and helper utilities used to
  interpret telemetry payloads.
- [`Migrations/context.md`](Migrations/context.md) – EF Core migration history describing the storage schema.
- [`opentelemetry/context.md`](opentelemetry/context.md) – vendored OpenTelemetry proto files consumed for code
  generation.

When modifying this project, update the nearest `context.md` to capture new dependencies, configuration flags, or
noteworthy behaviour so future agents can navigate quickly.
